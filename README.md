Exchange Currency

This project is making a simple Exchange Currency page by using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript.
It has three files that
* index.html
* style.css
* main.js

For exchanging events, I used [querySelectorAll, addEventListener, getElementById] and some functions that help to get the right value on the right time.
